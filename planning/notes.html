What problem am I trying to solve?
I need a central place to show off and explain my
code and design abilities. also need to display pertinent
information like name, location, contact info, social
media sites, and availability.



//ideas
- CSS Animations - bike moving, coffee cup steaming/swirling
- Skills are coding and design - want to display both
//responsive, flexible grid (allows website to scale dyanmically to f
to fit any device width)

.row {
	clear: both;
	mad-width: 1040px;
	margin: 0 auto;
}

//breakpoints Setting breakpoints based on content rather than device width is a more scalable solution. For example, rather than blindly setting a breakpoint at 768 pixels wide for tablets, I instead looked at my content and found that it looked fine until it got squashed under 600 pixels. I thus set a breakpoint at 600 pixels to change the layout to ensure that the content remains legible at and below this width. Yes, you will need to optimize the presentation of your website for various devices, but your content should always determine where the breakpoints lie. These are the four breakpoints I needed for my design: 320, 600, 1024 and 1140 pixels.
